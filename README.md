# CapitalOneSES
A repo of my submission for the Capital One Software Engineering Summit challenge

During the course of development, I ran into the challenge of transferring geographical data pulled from HTML5 Geolocation
to my Flask application. I attempted to make the transfer using AJAX, but I was not able to solve the
issue in time and resorted to using a separate library to find user location. I've included the HTML and JavaScript files I attempted
to use in the effort.
